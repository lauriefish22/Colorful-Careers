## API Deep Dive

Using fetch to request data from the Jsearch API 

Creating a function to set a value to the variable job that will be used in our query.  Getting our user inputs that will be used for our query from local storage.
```JS
function getJob() {
    var job;
    var userColor = localStorage.getItem("chosenColor")
    if (userColor === "Gold") {
        job = "Lawyer"
    }
    if (userColor === "Orange") {
        job = "Journalist"
    }
    if (userColor === "Green") {
        job = "Web developer"
    }
    if (userColor === "Blue") {
        job = "Mediator"
    }
    var city = localStorage.getItem("citystate")
```
Our fetch request which returned us a JSON object that we used to render job specific information onto our page
```
 var search = job + " " + city
    // fetch request to jsearch api with search variable and page parameters
    fetch('https://jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search?query=' + search + '&page=1&num_pages=1',
        {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                'X-RapidAPI-Key': '2a85d5b83amsh63ca45e7faf958fp1fa3e8jsnb8946c519ebe',
                'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'jsearch.p.rapidapi.com'
            }
        })
        .then(function(response){
            return response.json()
        })
         
        .then(function (data) {
            console.log(data)

           
```

We also experienced new libraries for CSS and JS.  Bulma was used for styling and Anime for JS.  Below are examples of both.


**ANIME**

Using anime.js to add animation to a button

Below is a code snippet and an example of the working element.  Anime is a great tool that is used with JavaScript to create animation on an app.

```anime({
    targets: '.button',
    translateY: [
        { value: 300, duration: 800 },
        { value: 0, duration: 800 }
    ],
    rotate: {
        value: '1turn',
        easing: 'easeInOutSine'
    }
});
```

## Joke API

For the Joke, we used Daddy Jokes API from RapidAPI.  The information from the API is shown below.

```joke: "I donâ€™t get why Marvel doesnâ€™t use the Hulk to advertise more. Heâ€™s basically one big Banner. "
success: true
[[Prototype]]: Object
script2.js:35
I donâ€™t get why Marvel doesnâ€™t use the Hulk to advertise more. Heâ€™s basically one big Banner.
```

## User Story:  I want to see a joke pop up

```
**BULMA**

Using Bulmas prebuilt elements to create a dropdown menu
```<div class="dropdown is-hoverable">
                <div class="dropdown-trigger">
                    <button class="button2" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="dropdown-menu">
                        <span id="colorchoice">Color Choice</span>
                        <span class="icon is-small">
                            <i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        </span>
```

## Usage 

Finds job openings based on users location and color choice.

## Learning Points 

It was great for all of us to explore different libraries.  It can be easy to get used to only one "way" but you never know what you are missing out on if you don't experience other libraries and opportunities to either improve your project or make it easier to build.  It was also great practice in using API's and finding out (the hard way) that you may need to go through multiple API's to find the one that works for your project.  More than anything, it was our first experience in working with a group and not only practicing using github and different branches but about communication and helping each other out when needed. 

* New js libraries
* Collaborative Git workflow
* Server side apis
* Bulma 
* Anime.js
