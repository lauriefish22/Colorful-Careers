## Code Example

```API's were the focus of this project and here is a great example of using the API for a job search to find careers by location.``` 

```var search = job + " " + city
    fetch('https://jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search?query=' + search + '&page=1&num_pages=1',
        {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'cc0e5ff229msha7a08edcb4e2fa7p13c5b7jsn7c2c39bc9ff4',
                'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'jsearch.p.rapidapi.com'
            }
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(function (data) {
            console.log(data)


            jobOptions.textContent = ""
            // console.log(data.data)
            for (var i = 0; i < data.data.length; i++)
            })
```
```We also experienced new libraries for CSS and JS.  Bulma was used for styling and Anime for JS.  Below are examples of both.``` 

**ANIME**

```anime({
    targets: '.button',
    translateY: [
        { value: 300, duration: 800 },
        { value: 0, duration: 800 }
    ],
    rotate: {
        value: '1turn',
        easing: 'easeInOutSine'
    }
});
```
**BULMA**

```<div class="dropdown is-hoverable">
                <div class="dropdown-trigger">
                    <button class="button2" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="dropdown-menu">
                        <span id="colorchoice">Color Choice</span>
                        <span class="icon is-small">
                            <i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        </span>
```
