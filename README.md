## Code Example

Using fetch to request data from the Jsearch API 

```JS
var search = job + " " + city
    fetch('https://jsearch.p.rapidapi.com/search?query=' + search + '&page=1&num_pages=1',
        {
            method: 'GET',
            headers: {
                'X-RapidAPI-Key': 'cc0e5ff229msha7a08edcb4e2fa7p13c5b7jsn7c2c39bc9ff4',
                'X-RapidAPI-Host': 'jsearch.p.rapidapi.com'
            }
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(function (data) {
            console.log(data)


            jobOptions.textContent = ""
            // console.log(data.data)
            for (var i = 0; i < data.data.length; i++)
            })
```
We also experienced new libraries for CSS and JS.  Bulma was used for styling and Anime for JS.  Below are examples of both.


**ANIME**

Using anime.js to add animation to a button
```anime({
    targets: '.button',
    translateY: [
        { value: 300, duration: 800 },
        { value: 0, duration: 800 }
    ],
    rotate: {
        value: '1turn',
        easing: 'easeInOutSine'
    }
});
```
**BULMA**

Using Bulmas prebuilt elements to create a dropdown menu
```<div class="dropdown is-hoverable">
                <div class="dropdown-trigger">
                    <button class="button2" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="dropdown-menu">
                        <span id="colorchoice">Color Choice</span>
                        <span class="icon is-small">
                            <i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                        </span>
```

## Usage

## Learning Points 

It was great for all of us to explore different libraries.  It can be easy to get used to only one "way" but you never know what you are missing out on if you don't experience other libraries and opportunities to either improve your project or make it easier to build.  It was also great practice in using API's and finding out (the hard way) that you may need to go through multiple API's to find the one that works for your project.  More than anything, it was our first experience in working with a group and not only practicing using github and different branches but about communication and helping each other out when needed. 

* New js libraries
* Collaborative Git workflow
* Server side apis
* Bulma 
* Anime.js
